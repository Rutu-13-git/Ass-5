STEP 6: Creating docker container to run Django
application

● Create a directory (e.g docker_demo in home directory)
● Open terminal
● $cd docker_demo
● $vi Dockerfile
//Add following lines to the file
FROM python:3
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1
RUN mkdir /app
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt /app/
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . /app/
● $vi requirements.txt
//Add following lines to the file
DJANGO==2.2
● $ vi docker-compose.yml
//Add following lines to the file

version: '3'
services:
	web:
		build: .
		command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:9000
		volumes:
			- .:/app
		ports:
			- "9000:9000"

● $ sudo docker compose run web django-admin startproject mysite .
● Check whether project is created or not: $ls -l
● If access to the project is restricted only to root user the change the
permissions: $sudo chown -R $USER:student .
● Check updated permissions: $ls -l
● Create and run the docker container: $docker compose up
● Go to browser and enter the following URL: localhost:9000. If you see
Django home page, that means Django has been successfully installed and
running in the container.
● You can not see the Django home page if you stop the container: $dockerstop 72cac95cec2f (container_id of Django container)
