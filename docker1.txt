STEP 1: Uninstall old versions
● Uninstall any such older versions before attempting to install a new version
$ sudo yum remove docker \
docker-client \
docker-client-latest \
docker-common \
docker-latest \
docker-latest-logrotate \
docker-logrotate \
docker-engine
STEP 2: Set up the repository
$sudo yum install -y yum-utils
$sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
STEP 3: Install Docker Engine
$sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
STEP 4: Manage Docker as a non-root user
Refer: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/
$ sudo groupadd docker

$ sudo usermod -aG docker symsc__
STEP 5: Running docker image
1. Hello -world image
$ sudo systemctl start docker 
$ docker run hello-world
(Note: if you get permission denied error for above command, run
$sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock)

● With the following command you can check how many
containers are running at current time:
$docker ps
● Following command will give list of container exist on the
machine
$docker ps -a
● To get list of images present on the machine:
$docker image ls
● To remove image from the system it is essential to remove all
containers that use the image in running or stopped state
● To remove container:
$docker rm container_id
● To remove the image from the system:
$docker rmi image_id

2. Using Ubuntu image
Pull the image: $docker image pull ubuntu:latest
Check image list: $docker image ls
Run ubuntu container in same terminal:
$docker run -it image_id_of_ubuntu_image /bin/bash

After executing the above command you will be redirected to
the ubuntu prompt. You can check by executing some linux
commands on this prompt. Remember that this container will
contain a very limited set of features. (you can run commands
like ls, whoami etc.)
